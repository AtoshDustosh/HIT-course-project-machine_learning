# machine_learning

This repository is built for the purpose of school course. 
It contains 4 parts: 
  1) polynomial fitting
  2) logistic regression
  3) k-means and GMM cluster
  4) PCA

Tools used for implementation - IntelliJ IDEA. 
Operating system - windows 10. 
Programming language - Java. 

All libraries are included separately in the programs. 

Annotations are detailed for program 1) 2) 3) but 4), because the last program is finished in a hurry ... maybe I will probably add it or re-construct program 4) in the future.
